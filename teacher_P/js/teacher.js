Mitra is the former head of theoretical astrophysics at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Mumbai and currently Adjunct Professor at the Homi Bhabha National Institute. His research has received widespread attention, especially in India, which is reflected from the fact that he is one of the most frequently mentioned Indian physicists on the web. He has proved that the so-called black holes cannot be true black holes even within the context of classical general relativity and that the Big Bang solution is illusory and actual universe must be fundamentally different from the big bang paradigm. NASA has approved that the latest findings are in accordance with the theory of this Indian astrophysicist who had theorized that the black holes are actually ultra hot balls of fire like our Sun."');
