            Unit-I:<br>
            Course Instructor should make an optimal use of cinema for increasing the students’ familiarity with English. Testing be done on the basis of the student’s comprehension of the plot and the ability of describe scenes from the film. Class room exercise of asking students to comment on the plot or scenes of a given film – not in writing but by standing before the entire class and speaking in English — be frequently carried out. The aim of this unit is to make the student feel confident about her/his ability to form sentence in English for discursive communication.<br>
            Unit-II:<br>
            Course Instructor should use audio tapes, Ted Lectures, radio news broadcast or celebrated speeches, etc for exposing the students’ to a ̳real time‘ and good spoken English. Class room tests be set to check the students’ ability to respond to their listening experience in writing. This will help the Course Instructor to continually assess the requirements of the students and provide corrective advise. Testing the writing skills of students will require setting several questions of very short composition tasks, from 50 words to 150 words. The topics chosen for the composition tasks should be selected from the topics covered in the classroom discussions or from the life on the campus.<br>
            Unit-III:<br>
            Students should be provided four to five extended samples of written English such as short stories or newspaper editorials for them to mark their difficulties – words, idioms, sentence structures, etc. This will help the students in
            improving their ability to do focused reading of serious written literature. Testing of the reading comprehension skills be tested by giving them in advance of the test several passages for reading. The Course Instructor may select one or more of those seen passages’ for the examination purpose.<br>
